ADAMANT’s market-making bot is software that enables trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. It helps generate trading volume, maintain spread and liquidity, set price ranges, and build a live-like dynamic order book.

This is the free version — suitable for small crypto projects with low liquidity, traded on centralized exchanges from the open list.

[Command reference](https://marketmaking.app/cex-mm/command-reference/).

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 20+, centOS 8+ (we didn't test others)
* NodeJS v18+
* MongoDB ([installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/))

## Setup

```
su - adamant
git clone https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-tradebot
cd ./adamant-tradebot
npm i
```

## Pre-launch tuning

The bot will use `config.jsonc` if available, or `config.default.jsonc` otherwise.

```
cp config.default.jsonc config.jsonc
nano config.jsonc
```

Parameters: see comments in `config.jsonc`.

## Launching

You can start the bot with the `node app` command, but it is recommended to run it under a process manager:

```
pm2 start app.js --name tradebot
```

Remember to add tradebot to `pm2 startup` or cron.

## Updating

```
su - adamant
cd ./adamant-tradebot
pm2 stop tradebot
git pull
npm i
```

Revise `config.jsonc` if `config.default.jsonc` changed.

Then `pm2 restart tradebot`.
